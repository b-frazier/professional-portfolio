# Professional Portfolio

As a bootcamp student, I am creating a professional portfolio to showcase my development work.

Future employers can find samples of my projects, work experience, and contact me directly from the page.

I will primarily be using HTML and CSS but I would like to try and implement a bit of JavaScript.
